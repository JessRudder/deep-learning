# Notes
## Beginners Guide to Deep Learning
- Machine learning has multiple uses
  - identify objects
  - transcribe speech to text
  - match news items/posts/products w/user interests
  - select relevant search results
  - etc
- Deep Learning (aka deep structured learning, deep machine learning)
  - attempt to model high level abstractions in data
  - simple case:
    - 2 sets of neurons (input and output)
    - input receives input and passes modified version to next layer
    - final layer provides output of all modified inputs
- generative deep architectures
  - characterize high-order correlation properties of observed/visible data
    good for pattern analysis/synthesis
- discriminative deep architectures
  - provide discriminative power for pattern classification
  - do this by characterizing posterior distribuions of classes conditioned in the visible data
- hybrid deep architectures
  - goal is discrimintation
  - assisted w/outcomes of generative architectures
- deep learning architectures in use today
  - deep feed-forward networks
  - convolution networks
  - recurrent networks
- deep feed-forward networks (feed-forward neural networks, multilayer perceptrons)
  - quintessential deep learning model
  - goal is to approximate some function f*
    - classifier y = f*(x) maps an input x to a category y
    - feed-forward network defines a mappying y = f(x;0) and learns the value of the parameters 0 that result in the best function approximation
  - simple terms:
    - network defined as input, hidden and output nodes
    - data comes in from input nodes
    - processing is done in hidden nodes
    - output produced through output nodes
  - info flows through function being evaluated from x, through intermediate computations used to define f, finally to output y
  - no feedback connections, model is not fed back into itself
